### Hi, I'm Derek
I am a systems engineer currently working to support a financial services technology organization. I don't always have time to work on intricate or highly visible projects, but I do my best to leverage git and GitHub in a way that lets me track the things I have learned and share with others to reference.

The code you might find here is not always production ready or reflective of my skills in various areas. I am always learning and refining my abilities.

I am enthusiastic about Linux, builiding infrastrucutre that supports application or network platforms, writing code, and automating the boring stuff. I love supporting my peers in reaching their goals or figuring out problems.
