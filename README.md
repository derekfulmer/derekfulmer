### Hi, I'm Derek
I am a systems engineer working to build automation platforms and infrastructure. I don't always have time to work on highly visible projects, but I do my best to leverage git and GitHub in a way that lets me track what I have learned and share with others to reference.

The code you might find here is not always production ready, though I try to commit _fairly_ polished code. I am always learning and refining my abilities.

I am enthusiastic about Linux, builiding infrastrucutre that supports application or network platforms, writing code, and automating the boring stuff. I love supporting my peers in reaching their goals or figuring out problems.
