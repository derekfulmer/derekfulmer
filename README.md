### Hi, I'm Derek
I am a systems engineer infrastructure, automation, and writing some code. I don't always have time to work on highly visible projects, but I do my best to leverage git and GitHub in a way that lets me track what I have learned and share with others to reference.

Some of the code you will find here is not necessarily production ready. I am always learning and expanding my abilities.

I am enthusiastic about writing code, Linux, building automation, and helping others move forward toward their goals.
